# Define a complete server with a LAMP stack, clean URLs, and the right PHP settings
# to develop a Drupal 6 site.
# Usage:
# (1) make sure you have docker installed (on Mac, you can install a CoreOS vagrant box
#     which has docker pre-installed)
# (2) run ./dcycle/deploy.sh to get a development environment.
# (3) visit the IP address of your computer or core os vagrant box.
# (4) start developing

# Because this is the production Dockerfile, we will want the database to be
# persistent. The database is stored in a bunch of files at /var/lib/mysql/drupal,
# including /var/lib/mysql/drupal/users.frm. Because these files should be persistent
# on the host, the -v flag will be used during the docker build process, which will
# overwrite /var/lib/mysql/drupal with whatever is on the host (which can be empty).
# To overcome this, we will store the entre /var/lib/mysql/drupal folder in /tmp/database.
# Later on, the script which installs the Docker container will check if a (persistent)
# database exists, and use if it does; and use the stored db if none exists yet.
RUN mv /var/lib/mysql/drupal /tmp/initial-database
