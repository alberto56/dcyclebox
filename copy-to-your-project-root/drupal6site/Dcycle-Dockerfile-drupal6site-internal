# Define a complete server with a LAMP stack, clean URLs, and the right PHP settings
# to develop a Drupal 6 site.
# Usage:
# (1) make sure you have docker installed (on Mac, you can install a CoreOS vagrant box
#     which has docker pre-installed)
# (2) run ./dcycle/deploy.sh to get a development environment.
# (3) visit the IP address of your computer or core os vagrant box.
# (4) start developing
