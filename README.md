Dcyclebox
-----

The goal of this project is

 * to provide a **minimal set of Docker tools** to add to Drupal modules and Drupal websites, for a development-stage-production workflow.
 * to provide a working example of what a Docker-based workflow might look like.
 * to provide a lot of commenting and documentation to get a working understanding of Docker and Drupal.

Development status
-----

This project is experimental and in very preliminary stage of development. **Do not use it yet**. If you are interested in Docker-Drupal integration, you can see the [alberto56/docker-drupal](https://github.com/alberto56/docker-drupal) project on GitHub. The difference between that project and Dcyclebox is that Dcyclebox is aimed to be more streamlined and more documented, and generally easier to approach for those new to Docker.

Test status

This project is tested by the awesome [Circle CI](https://circleci.com/) continuous integration platform.
